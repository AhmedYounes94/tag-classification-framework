        Pre-processing: pipeline components of this type add more information to the
                        tweet. They do not extract any features, so alone will have zero
                        affect on the classifier. Components of type "feature-inferrer"

    description:
        This is a pre-processing step that is required in order to use the dependency 
        parser. It creates a second way of tokenising a sentence, which is informed by the 
        way in which the CMU tokeniser has tokenised the sentence. It removes tokens which
        are not part of the syntax of the sentence (i.e. what the parser should ignore).
        It makes the CMU tokens more recognisable to the parser, which has to be trained
        on a different type of token.

        This component adds dependency relations to the tweet. These are relations
        between two words which identify how those words work together. For example,
        in the sentence: "The dog bit the man". "man" is the direct object of the verb
        "bit", i.e. the man is on the receiving end of the action. Therefore, "man" will
        be annotated to point to "bit" as its head, with "dobj" (for direct object) as its 
        relation. See here for full details on the relations used:
